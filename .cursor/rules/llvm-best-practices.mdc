- Optimize LLVM IR generation for better performance in Aegis applications.
- Use LLVM's Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for immediate code execution.
- Leverage LLVM's Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation for native binary generation.
- Profile and benchmark your LLVM IR to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.
