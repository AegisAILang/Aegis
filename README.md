# Aegis - AI Control & Guidance

Aegis is an AI-optimized, high-performance, and type-safe programming language designed for deterministic, error-free code generation. Built on LLVM and WebAssembly, Aegis empowers developers to create secure and scalable applications with a focus on clarity and efficiency.

## üéì Why isn't this just another language?

- Deterministic Sytax: Indentation-based with no hidden conversions.
- Minimal Ambiguity:
- Easy to Parse: Tokenized
- Strong Typing: No null by default
- Strict: Forces code correctness to help AI produce fewer errors.
- Compiled, memory-safe, and type-safe by default.
- Scalable & Modular: Support modules, package manager, and a standard library.
- Compilation Targets: LLVM IR, WebAssembly, and native binaries.
- **Made for AI:** Straightforward scoping, no tricky corner cases, and minimal variance.

## üî• Features

- **AI-Optimized Code Generation:**  
  Leverage AI-driven tools to automatically generate, validate, and optimize code.

- **Strong Type Safety:**  
  Aegis enforces strict typing with no null values, ensuring predictable behavior.

- **High Performance:**  
  Utilizes LLVM for native compilation and supports WebAssembly for portable, browser-based execution.

- **Built-in Standard Library:**  
  Includes robust functionality for arithmetic, string manipulation, file I/O, networking, and date/time operations.

- **Modular Design & Package Management:**  
  Easily structure your projects with modules and manage dependencies with Aegis‚Äô integrated package manager.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the installation script to set up Aegis on your system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aegis.git
cd aegis
./install.sh
```

Note: Ensure you have LLVM, Clang, and Python 3 installed on your system.

## Usage

### Compiling Aegis Code

To compile an Aegis source file (e.g., example.ae), run:

```bash
python compiler/aegis_compiler.py examples/example.ae
```

This will:
    - Tokenize and parse your source code.
    - Perform semantic analysis and type checking.
    - Generate LLVM IR.
    - Optionally run JIT compilation to execute your code.

### AI-Driven Code Generation

Aegis includes an AI code generator for scaffolding SaaS modules and enterprise projects. To generate sample code:

```bash
python compiler/aegis_ai_generator.py
```

This script will output AI-generated Aegis code that you can further modify.

### Example

Below is a simple Aegis example:

```bash
module UserSystem:

    struct User:
        name: string
        age: int

    fn get_user(name: string) -> User:
        return User(name, 25)
```

Save this as examples/example.ae and compile it using the instructions above.
